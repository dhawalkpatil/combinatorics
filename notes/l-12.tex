\begin{definition}[Power series]
	A \emph{formal power series} over a field $\mathbb{K}$ in a variable $z$
	is an expression of the form
	$$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n,$$
	where $a_n$ is in $\mathbb{K}$ for each positive integer $n.$
\end{definition}
The set of all formal power series over $\mathbb{K}$ 
in a variable $t$ is denoted by $ \mathbb{K} [[t]]].$
A power series is distinct from a power series in that the latter 
is defined contingent upon convergence.
\begin{definition}[Polynomial]
	A polynomial in a variable $t$ over a ring $R$ is an expression
	$$ f(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} a_j t^j $$
	where $n$ is a fixed nonnegative integer and $a_n$ is in $R$ for each integer $j \geq 0$ and $j \leq n.$
\end{definition}
The degree of a polynomial $f(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} a_n t^j$ is denoted as
$\deg(f(t)) = \max \left\{ m \; : \; a_m \not = 0 \right\}.$ The set of polynomials in $t$
with coefficients in $R$ is denoted by $R$

Given a polynomial $f(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n}  a_n t^n$ over $\mathbb{K}$ in $t,$ we can talk
about the associated polynomial function, which is independent of the variable $t.$
Call it $\tilde{f}.$ It is defined as 
$$ \tilde{f} (t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} a_n t^n, \qquad (\text{t } \in \mathbb{K} ).$$
Defining an associated power series for a gievn formal power series needs more care
as it may not converge in $R.$

Operations on $R [[t]]$ include
$$ \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n \right) 
+ \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n t^n \right) 
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (a_n + b_n ) t^n.$$
and
$$ \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n \right) 
\cdot \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n t^n \right) 
 = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n t^n,$$
 where $c_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}.$
\begin{example}
	For $t$ in $\mathbb{C},$ we have
	$$ \frac{1}{1-t} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  t^n $$
	if $ \lvert t \rvert < 1.$
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Exponential power series]
	For all $t $ in $\mathbb{C},$ we have
	$$ e^t = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!} $$
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Derivative of a power series]
	Given a power series 
	$$f(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n, \quad \text{for all} \quad t \in \mathbb{C},$$
	the derivative $f'$ is well defined with
	$$f'(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n a_n t^{n-1} .$$
\end{example}
